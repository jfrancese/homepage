<h1> <b> James Anthony Francese </b> </h1>

<h2> Mathematician & Philosopher </h2>

<br><br>

<p> My name is James Francese, and I'm currently a senior undergraduate 
studying mathematics and philosophy at Chapman University. </p>
 
<p>
In mathematics, my research moves between geometry and algebra, 
with recent work in the deformation theory of finite-dimensional 
algebras and problems concerning topological groups. I also recurringly 
work on areas within mathematical physics.</p>

<p> My philosophical work is mostly in metaphysics and epistemology, 
with a special focus on causality. I also maintain strong interests 
in logic and the foundations of mathematics. </p>
